    <h1>Generation of Real Looking Images Using GANs</h1>
  </div>
</div>

## Abstract
Automatic image generation is a complex task with many applications in several domains such as security (e.g., gener- ating portraits from the description), styling and entertainment. In this project, advanced versions of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used to generate real images. A conditional GAN (cGAN) was implemented, followed by an evaluation with visual examination, k-nearest-Neighbours (kNN) and Fre ÃÅchet Inception Distance (FID). The evaluation indicates that a cGAN can generate realistic images of handwritten digits. Whereas, the discussions shows that more work must be done to create realistic images from datasets which contains larger and more complex images.

## How do I get the code?

You should know that.

## How do I get the data?

Unfortunately, the data is not provided on a public host. So, please do it the old fashioned way and write an [email](timo.bohnstedt@gmail.com), so that we can find a way.

## What else do I need to run the code?

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mad40-env
```

### How can I Run the Notebook/ Source?

You should know that as well :P

## Deployment

Just pull the repo, if you wanna change sth you can ask :)

Please do NOT commit any data files into the repositories. Data should always be kept seperate from code!
